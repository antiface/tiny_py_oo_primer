a tiny object-orientation primer for python
-------------------------------------------

This is a tutorial thought as a tiny introduction to the spaces opened by creating useful class definitions in python. It is targeted in particular at practitioners in science and engineering. ComSci pros sometimes tend to explaining key features of object-orientation too abstractly and then adding generic examples where the abstract feature becomes clear, but the usefulness not (so easily for the newbie). Any point made in this tutorial, however, is tried to be put into quickly graspable practical context.

The tutorial is tiny, so just those few things are addressed which appeared most important to me (in my momentary level of understanding).

Sorry to all who don't speak German, the rest of the explanations inside the source code files is still in German.


content:
--------
 - lesson 1 (twofuncs_A.py) -- memory about function state
 - lesson 2 (produce_data.py) -- just making a data set to work with
 - lesson 3 (process_data.py) -- a procedural program
 - lesson 4 (process_data_oo.py) -- the same in object-oriented manner
 - lesson 5 (unpickle_mda.py) -- reduce the number of occasions for writing `write_output()` and `read_stuff()` routines
 - lesson 6 (twofuncs_B.py) -- magic methods
 - lesson 7 (twofuncs_C.py) -- interacting objects, it's all about external access to namespaces
 - lesson 8 (twofuncs_D.py) -- heredity
 
The purposes of each lesson are outlined in the file lessons.txt.
