a tiny object-orientation primer for python
-------------------------------------------

Often it happens that scientists and engineers happen to become everyday programmers over the course of the years
even though they never actively planned that - like me. Sometimes this has the negative consequence of an initially
incredibly ugly programming style, because you just never properly learnt to do it the right way - like me. Only after
a while one discovers the virtues of well organised program code and starts to try to adapt good habits from those
code examples where the good style once helped to understand a concept quicker than equally performant code in ugly
shape.

An object-oriented setup and class definitions can be of incredible help of organising code. But often the virtues of
object-orientation need some time to be grasped even for grown-up scientists. Here I tried my best to come up with the shortest and crispest possible set of python scripts for hinting towards the core advantages available by defining classes of objects.

And this is also to all those users of popular commercial tools for scientific data crunching: python is more than a way to write job scripts and macros, it's more than a data analysis suite, it's a real programming language! Here's a glimpse at the freedom given to you by that.

Greets!

--------
 - lesson 1 (twofuncs_A.py) -- memory about function state
 - lesson 2 (produce_data.py) -- just making a data set to work with
 - lesson 3 (process_data.py) -- a procedural program
 - lesson 4 (process_data_oo.py) -- the same in object-oriented manner
 - lesson 5 (unpickle_mda.py) -- reduce the number of occasions for writing `write_output()` and `read_stuff()` routines
 - lesson 6 (twofuncs_B.py) -- magic methods
 - lesson 7 (twofuncs_C.py) -- interacting objects, it's all about external access to namespaces
 - lesson 8 (twofuncs_D.py) -- heredity
 
 Sorry to all who don't speak German, the rest of the explanations in the files is in German.
